# Robust-HR-Estimation_based-on-Adaptive-Patch-Selection
A sample video from Pose-Variant HR dataset is in the folder named Pose-VariantHR-dataset, whose groundtruth HR is 54 bpm.

To download the rest of the dataset as well as groundtruth, please click https://drive.google.com/open?id=107qkwrrNBABCUp3DjPq9sm4ogRl-Y902

We are sorry that kineticHR video of object#6 and videos of object#9 were lost.

The file named 'GT' recorded the groundtruth HRs of videos and baseline results of our proposed method.
Each line of this file indicates the index number of object, basalHR groundtruth, kineticHR groundtruth and the baseline results.
